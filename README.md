# BN-TechnologyExperience-Software Development Solution
This is my solution to the software development challenge posed to the people taking on the BrightNetwork Internship experience. 
I chose to do the software development task, I produced this over two days in response to the briefs from Google. 

### Project Goals

The objective of this project was to take the original source code: 
https://github.com/internship-experience-uk/google-code-sample

And then produce our own solutions to the tasks finishing the stubbed out methods. Inside of the video player class. 
This is my solution to the requirements that google laid out.

For details please refer to the pdf file named 'MorganRuffellBN_Documentation.pdf', it lays out each method and shows what I've made and for what purpose.
